# AudioPlayerPopup
Audio Player Design in SwiftUI.

SwiftUI makes it enjoyable to develop interactive features like this audio player. This popup audio player displays album artwork, the track title, playback controls, and a close button. Itâ€™s simple yet functional.

The player logic is structured using the MVI pattern. It includes forward and rewind functions for 5-second intervals, and the player automatically closes when the track ends.
